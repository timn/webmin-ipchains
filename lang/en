index_devnotdef=Network Devices not defined
index_desc_devdef=You have not defined, which of your network interfaces (Network Interface Card, ISDN Card, DSL, Modem) should be considered to be the internal interface (connected to your Local Area Network) and which to be the external interface (interface connected to the outer network, for example the Internet). Just select one of the network devices from the list. They have been found on your system.
index_intdev=Internal Device
index_extdev=External Device
index_saveifaces=Save Interfaces
index_bootnotdef=Init directory not defined
index_desc_bootdef=The module cannot determine in which directory your init script reside. So please set the directory appropriate to your distribution. This is needed to find the best position for the firewall script and to make this script ran at bootup.
index_dir=Directory
index_saveinitdir=Save Init Directory
index_sfnotdef=Script File not defined
index_desc_sfdef=You have not yet set the location of the script file. This script file will contain all calls for ipchains. Do NOT give the location of ipchains. Give the name of an non-existent file. The module will make a suggestion depending on the location of the directory for init scripts on your system. Usually it is a sufficient guess.

index_customize=Customize...
index_customlevel=You are running a customized Firewall

index_router=Router Firewall
index_personal=Personal Firewall
index_dhcpnotdev=Does your external interface get information via DHCP?
index_desc_dhcpdef=The module could not find out if your external interface gets its information via DHCP. This is important for the firewall rules. If you say "Yes" (the external interface gets information like IP address and netmask from a DHCP server, common when using an ISP for dialup) the firewall script will determine the outside IP address. This takes longer on activating the rules. You will have to configure you system to execute the script every time a new address is assigned! If you say "No" (the external interface does not use DHCP) the module will save the IP address the assigned to the external interface when creating the rules.

lib_err_sfmiss=The script file $1 you entered in the <A HREF=../config.cgi?ipchains>module configuration</A> does not exist. Use the <A HREF="script_manager.cgi">Script Manager</A> to create a plain script. After you created it come back and all works properly. This is a normal configuration step and not an real error, but one step ahead to a working IPchains Module installation!
lib_icmptsel=ICMP-Type Selection
lib_err_protomis=Cannot find protocol file. $1
lib_err_netmod=You have choosen or it is set by default to use the Network Configuration Module to get all you network interfaces. But this module is not available on your system. Either it is not installed or your system is not supported. So just enter all interfaces in the <A HREF=/config.cgi?ipchains>module configuration</A> as a comma-separated list (for example "eth0, eth1, ippp0, lo").
lib_err_syn=Syntax error (Type $1) in line $2
lib_err_host=Host file $1 does not exist
lib_err_create=Cannot create file $1
lib_noinit=Could not find your init directory. You have to set it manually. $1.

sman_bootup=Make Bootup Entry
sman_bootupdesc=This will make an entry for your script in your RC. This will start the script on every bootup in runlevels 2, 3 and 5. Therefore the script must reside in <I>$1</I>.

import_title=Import Settings
import_desc=With this script you can import the current settings from your system. If you click on the button this script will gather the information about chains and rules directly from your system (proc filesystem) and will "transform" them to a script which you can then edit with this module. This makes it very easy to migrate from another configuration tool and to use scripts you found on the Internet. Just load the scripts and then import the settings.
