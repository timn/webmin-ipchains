##-> Allows clients on the internal network to access a FTP servers running 
##-> on the firewall host.
##-> This template allows PASSIVE transfers. To allow passive transfers is 
##-> very risky as it allows to open connections to all unpfivileged ports on
##-> the outside network. If it is not absolutely needed you should not enable 
##-> this template. Use Active FTP instead. But some FTP clients (as for 
##-> example the ones built into webbrowser) do not support active FTP.
##-> Keep in mind that FTP passwords are transferred as clear text!
