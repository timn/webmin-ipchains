lib_err_nosupport=Either the proc filesystem or IPchains is not supported by your kernel.
lib_err_ipchains=File $1 does not exist or is not executable. $2
lib_err_sfcm=You have not entered a script file. It is needed because all rules will be written with the appropriate directives into this script file. $1
lib_err_sfmiss=The script file $1 you entered in the <A HREF=../config.cgi?ipchains>module configuration</A> does not exist. Use the <A HREF="script_manager.cgi">Script Manager</A> to create a plain script. After you created it come back and all works properly. This is a normal configuration step and not an real error, but one step ahead to a working IPchains Module installation!
lib_icmptsel=ICMP-Type Selection
lib_err_protomis=Cannot find protocol file. $1
lib_err_netmod=You have choosen to use the Network Configuration Module to get all you network interfaces. But this module is not available on your system. Either it is not installed or your system is not supported. So just enter all interfaces in the <A HREF=/config.cgi?ipchains>module configuration</A> as a comma-separated list (for example "eth0, eth1, ippp0, lo").
lib_err_syn=Syntax error (Type $1) in line $2

sman_bootup=Make Bootup Entry
sman_bootupdesc=This will make an entry for your script in your RC. This will start the script on every bootup in runlevels 2, 3 and 5. Therefore the script must reside in $1. If it is not the case you cannot make an entry to start it on every bootup, but you have to manually start it every time.
