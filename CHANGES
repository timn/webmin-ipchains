 This file describes the changes made to the IPchains Firewalling Webmin Module.
 (Version history).


 Changes
 ==============================================================================
 30.10.1999  - Added support for SYN-Bit and Fragment
 (0.74.1)    - Added support for ICMP-type, get types from "ipchains -h icmp"
             - Protocol field is now a list, content is generated
               by parsing /etc/protocols
             - Type Of Service (TOS) is now supported
             - Module can now handle a list of often used hosts and you
               now can select hosts comfortable via a file-chooser-like window
             - Port can now be defined as service from /etc/services,
               comfortable access via popup window
             - Script manager now accessible through index
 15.11.1999  - You may not INPUT and APPEND a rule instead of only appending
 (0.74.2)    - Fixed bug in save_policy.cgi, it now uses $ipchains_path to
               save the new rule instead of using $config{'ipchains_path'}
             - You do not need to deliver Source and Destination Address any
               more for ICMP Protocol (as it is often not use in conjunction
               with --icmp-type
             - You may now choose MASQ as Target in any user defined chain,
               the script controls if there's any non-forward chain that points
               to the appropriate chain (on adding a MASQ-Target to the chain
               and if the user tries to add a jump target to the appropriate
               chain from any other chain)
             - Fixed some minor errors in rm_jump() and find_chain_struct()
             - Did several changes to get all functions supporting -I Insertion
             - Added entry for Caldera OpenLinux in module.info
             - Now uses foreign_calls to net-module for getting a list of
               active interfaces (easier and more comfortable way)
 16.11.1999  - Wrote a short help to edit_chains.cgi
 (0.74.2)    - I have no school today ;)
 10.03.2000  - Added the promised Script Manager features, it can now make
 (0.78.1)      the a bootup script, create and delete it and remove boot entry
             - It is now possible to clone existing rules. So it is easier to
               write new rules
             - Logging flag (-l) is now supported
             - Changed the "Edit Chain" page. New rule creation is now on
               another page. Changed the layout of the creation mask.
             - Fixed $ipchains bug
             - Fixed change_policy bug, now rewrites these rules correctly
             - Added ACL features
 13.03.2000  - Fixed bug in change_policy.cgi
 (0.78.2)    - Fixed bug in ipchains-lib.pl (missing $cl in error message for
               missing script file)
 14.03.2000  - Fix of some bugs
 (0.78.3)
 
 20.03.2000  - Fix of some bugs more (often said chain instead of chains in
 (0.78.4)      ACL checks
             - Fixed bug when saving a rule with only dest or source, not both.
               Before the save_rule set the -s AND -d option, although if one
               was empty...
 22.03.2000  - Fixed a bug in save_host.cgi, again a problem with the ACL code,
 (0.78.5)      I shouldn't do such things after a gaming session...

 08.06.2000  - Fixed bug with ICMP Type option, must be --icmp-type, not
 (0.80.1)      --icmptype as I wrote. An older special patched version used
               this style, but it seems that all distros are nowadays using
               the new format
 30.06.2000  - Added "Execute Script" in Script Manager
 (0.80.2)
 03.07.2000  - Added move_rule.cgi, you can now move rules up and down in the
               file.
             - Changed the way Append and Insert are handled in save_rule.
               Therefore I removed the support for the -I insert flag. It
               generally appends new rules. But with insert the module now
               places the line for this rule at the beginning of this chain.
               So it is easier to maintain the rules. The -I flag is just a
               solution if you forgot a rule on manual setup, but when editing
               a file it makes is just more complex and it is not really needed
               Because you can now move rules up and down this is the best
               thing I can to I think.
 11.07.2000  - Added chinese translation patch. Thanks to Leo Liang (from
               Turbo Linux China) for this patch.
             - Configuration now only available on index as in standard mods
             - Smaller CleanUps.
 12.07.2000  - Added import.cgi to import current system settings. Getting
               info directly from /proc. Indication works fine, now I have to
               implement the correct rule creation (in the script). But now I
               have first to sleep a little bit (it's 3:00 am ;).
             - It's done. Now you can import current system settings into a
               script. Works fine with all supported arguments (including
               their negation of course). Some hours of sleep are wonderful ;)
             - Removed bug in find_param_2, it added ! as a value if it was
               the negation of a following line argument
               (example: -s 192.168.1.1/32 ! -y).
 14.07.2000  - Removed critical bug in import.cgi. I forgot a =, so that I
               didn't compare but set the proto value. So the protocol was
               always ICMP. Big fault. Thanks to Manuel Carrasco from
               Lucent Technologies for reporting this.
 
 To do
 ==============================================================================
 - iptables support (maybe a new module).
