##-> Allows the firewall host to open connections to FTP servers on the 
##-> internal network.
##-> This template allows PASSIVE transfers. To allow passive transfers is 
##-> very risky as it allows to open connections to all unprivileged ports on
##-> the inside network. If it is not absolutely needed you should not enable 
##-> this template. Use Active FTP instead. But some FTP clients (as for 
##-> example the ones built into webbrowser) do not support active FTP.
##-> Keep in mind that FTP passwords are transferred as clear text!
##-> These rules maybe useful for a personal firewall.
