<header>IPchains Firewalling - Editing a Chain</header>

This file describes the editing of chains in this module<P>

First, you surely want to know, what all those columns in the
table are good for, so here you are:<BR><BR>

<U>Source</U><BR>
As you may guess, this column represents the source address, a
packet comes from. The following port column is the source port.

<BR><BR><U>Destination</U><BR>
The destination of a packet. For example you want http to go
through but to block ftp. All those warez servers...

<BR><BR><U>Protocol</U><BR>
This is the protocol the packet is sent in. The usual types are
TCP or UDP, often also ICMP for pings, traceroute and some
net watchers to check the availability of your servers. You may
want to leave specific packets through, but others not. Note,
that the protocol does not mean the high level protocols like
http or ftp but the low level netlink protocols.

<BR><BR><U>Interface</U><BR>
This defines the interface, the rule applies for. For input
packets this is the device they came in on, the interface
for forward and output packets is the device they will leave on.
Perhaps there is one "trusted" interface which is allowed to
deliver all packets, but another (connected perhaps to the
internet) is only allowed to deliver specific packages...

<BR><BR><U>S (SYN-Bit)</U><BR>
Indicates, whether the SYN-Bit for packets must be set, must not
be set or it may be set.<BR>
If it must be set there is a X, if it must not be set there is
a ! and if it may be set there is nothing.

<BR><BR><U>F (Fragment)</U><BR>
Matches the secont through the last fragment of a fragmented packet.
No ports may be specified.
If it must be set there is a X, if it must not be set there is
a ! and if it may be set there is nothing.

<BR><BR><U>TOS (Type Of Service)</U><BR>
ipchains can change the TOS of a packet. To do this there are several
possible values. This is shown in this column.

<BR><BR><U>T (Type)</U><BR>
Indicates the type, on which the rule is included. May be either
A for Append or I for Insert (on the first place of the chain).
