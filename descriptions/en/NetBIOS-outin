##-> Allows clients on the external network to speak to NetBIOS servers 
##-> on the inside network. Inside computers will also be able to reach 
##-> your servers on the external network.
##-> Keep in mind that Broadcast packets do NOT pass the firewall. So machines 
##-> on the outside cannot find servers on the inside without using a WINS 
##-> server (which can be done with Samba).
##-> This connection type is NOT supported when using Masquerading!
